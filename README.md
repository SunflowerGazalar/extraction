Hello everybody!

I'm very interested in [Mathias Eitz's works](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/sbsr/) on SIGGRAPH 2012, so I developed OpenSSE, Just for fun.

This is an open source sketch search engine for 3D object retrieval based on sketch image as input. In fact, it can retrieve more, such as images, videos, point cloud models and volume models, you just need get their line drawing images than I know you can.

In order to clearly show how to work, I used single thread and ascii encoding for file storage.

Demoes powered by OpenSSE
=========================

* Open Sketch Search

This demo deals with 3D mesh models. See more search results, click [demo videos](http://opensse.com).

* Open Sketch Recognize

Recognize input sketch image, you can try it via [web version](http://online.opensse.com/). See more search results, click [demo videos](http://sr.opensse.com/).

How to install
==============

OpenSSE library uses [OpenCV 3.0.0+](http://opencv.org/) and [boost 1.55.0](http://www.boost.org/), it's a cross-platform library.

You can compile and install it like below:

```sh
mkdir release && cd release
cmake ..
make
make install
```

Troubleshooting
===============
- Could not resolve SDK path for 'macosx10.9'

  There is a workaround:
  Navigate to where you installed Qt (default /Users/your username/Qt) using finder
  Go to the subdirectory `.../5.3/clang_64/mkspecs` directory

  Open the file called qdevice.pri with a text editor
  Change the line !host_build:QMAKE_MAC_SDK = macosx10.9 to:
  * !host_build:QMAKE_MAC_SDK
    = macosx10.10 if you are on OS X 10.10 (Yosemit
  * !host_build:QMAKE_MAC_SDK
    = macosx10.11 if you are on OS X 10.11 (EI Captian))

To do list
==========
- A sketch collect, share and evaluate platform
- A better search framework
- A new rank algorithm
